# 602. Friend Requests II: Who Has the Most Friends - SQL Solution Explanation

## Problem Overview
Find the **person with the most friends** from a friend request acceptance table.
- **Bidirectional friendship**: If A sends request to B and B accepts, both A and B are friends
- Return the **person ID and their friend count**
- **Test cases guarantee only one person has the maximum friend count**

## Input Data Understanding

### Original Data
```sql
RequestAccepted table:
+--------------+-------------+-------------+
| requester_id | accepter_id | accept_date |
+--------------+-------------+-------------+
| 1            | 2           | 2016/06/03  |
| 1            | 3           | 2016/06/08  |
| 2            | 3           | 2016/06/08  |
| 3            | 4           | 2016/06/09  |
+--------------+-------------+-------------+
```

### Friendship Analysis
```
ID 1's friends: 2, 3 (1 sent 2 requests)
ID 2's friends: 1, 3 (1 as accepter, 1 as requester)
ID 3's friends: 1, 2, 4 (2 as accepter, 1 as requester)
ID 4's friends: 3 (1 as accepter)

Result: ID 3 has the most friends (3 total)
```

## Step-by-Step Solution Breakdown

### Step 1: Understanding the UNION ALL Subquery

```sql
(
    SELECT requester_id AS id FROM RequestAccepted
    UNION ALL
    SELECT accepter_id AS id FROM RequestAccepted
) AS AllFriends
```

#### UNION ALL Operation
```sql
-- requester_id AS id results
+----+
| id |
+----+
| 1  |
| 1  |
| 2  |
| 3  |
+----+

-- accepter_id AS id results  
+----+
| id |
+----+
| 2  |
| 3  |
| 3  |
| 4  |
+----+

-- UNION ALL combined result (AllFriends)
+----+
| id |
+----+
| 1  |
| 1  |
| 2  |
| 3  |
| 2  |
| 3  |
| 3  |
| 4  |
+----+
```

**Key Points:**
- **UNION ALL**: Combines all rows without removing duplicates
- **Each friendship counted twice**: A→B relationship adds both A and B to the list
- **AllFriends subquery result**: Table with only one `id` column

### Step 2: GROUP BY and COUNT(*) Operation

```sql
SELECT
    id,
    COUNT(*) AS num
FROM
    (subquery) AS AllFriends
GROUP BY
    id
```

#### Detailed GROUP BY Operation
```sql
-- AllFriends grouped by id
Group 1 (id=1): [1, 1] → COUNT(*) = 2
Group 2 (id=2): [2, 2] → COUNT(*) = 2  
Group 3 (id=3): [3, 3, 3] → COUNT(*) = 3
Group 4 (id=4): [4] → COUNT(*) = 1
```

#### Intermediate Result
```sql
+----+-----+
| id | num |
+----+-----+
| 1  | 2   |
| 2  | 2   |
| 3  | 3   |
| 4  | 1   |
+----+-----+
```

## Understanding "ORDER BY num DESC" - Alias Reference

### SQL Logical Execution Order

**SQL processes queries in this logical order:**
```sql
1. FROM clause (subquery execution)
2. WHERE clause
3. GROUP BY clause
4. HAVING clause
5. SELECT clause ← "COUNT(*) AS num" executes here
6. ORDER BY clause ← "ORDER BY num" executes here
7. LIMIT clause
```

### Detailed Explanation

#### ✅ **Correct: SELECT clause alias definition comes first**
```sql
SELECT
    id,
    COUNT(*) AS num  -- "num" alias defined here
FROM ...
GROUP BY id
ORDER BY num DESC   -- Can reference "num" defined in SELECT clause
```

**Why this works:**
1. **GROUP BY execution**: Data grouped by id
2. **SELECT clause execution**: `COUNT(*) AS num` calculated, creating `num` column in result set
3. **ORDER BY execution**: References existing `num` column for sorting

#### ❌ **AllFriends subquery does NOT contain num column**
```sql
-- AllFriends structure (no num column)
+----+
| id |
+----+
| 1  |
| 1  |
| 2  |
| 3  |
| ... |
+----+
```

### Actual Processing Flow

```sql
-- Step 1: Subquery execution (FROM clause)
AllFriends → Table with only id column

-- Step 2: GROUP BY execution
Data grouped by id

-- Step 3: SELECT clause execution
COUNT(*) calculated for each group, num alias assigned
Result: Intermediate table with id, num columns

-- Step 4: ORDER BY execution  
Uses num column created in SELECT clause for sorting

-- Step 5: LIMIT execution
Returns only top 1 row
```

## Alias Reference Rules in SQL

### Valid Reference Patterns
```sql
-- ✅ SELECT alias in ORDER BY
SELECT salary * 12 AS annual_salary
FROM employees
ORDER BY annual_salary DESC;

-- ✅ SELECT alias in HAVING (some DBMS)
SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS avg_sal
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
HAVING avg_sal > 50000;
```

### Invalid Reference Patterns
```sql
-- ❌ SELECT alias in WHERE (not allowed)
SELECT salary * 12 AS annual_salary
FROM employees
WHERE annual_salary > 100000;  -- Error

-- ❌ SELECT alias in GROUP BY (some DBMS don't allow)
SELECT YEAR(hire_date) AS hire_year, COUNT(*)
FROM employees
GROUP BY hire_year;  -- MySQL: OK, PostgreSQL: Error
```

## Step 3: Final Sorting and Limiting

```sql
ORDER BY num DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

### Execution Result
```sql
-- After ORDER BY num DESC
+----+-----+
| id | num |
+----+-----+
| 3  | 3   | ← Most friends
| 1  | 2   |
| 2  | 2   |
| 4  | 1   |
+----+-----+

-- After LIMIT 1 (final result)
+----+-----+
| id | num |
+----+-----+
| 3  | 3   |
+----+-----+
```

## Follow-up: Multiple People with Same Maximum Friends

### Solution Approaches
```sql
-- Solution 1: Subquery with MAX value
SELECT id, COUNT(*) AS num
FROM (
    SELECT requester_id AS id FROM RequestAccepted
    UNION ALL
    SELECT accepter_id AS id FROM RequestAccepted
) AS AllFriends
GROUP BY id
HAVING COUNT(*) = (
    SELECT MAX(friend_count) FROM (
        SELECT COUNT(*) AS friend_count
        FROM (
            SELECT requester_id AS id FROM RequestAccepted
            UNION ALL
            SELECT accepter_id AS id FROM RequestAccepted
        ) AS AllFriends2
        GROUP BY id
    ) AS MaxFriends
);

-- Solution 2: Window Function (more elegant)
WITH FriendCounts AS (
    SELECT 
        id,
        COUNT(*) AS num,
        MAX(COUNT(*)) OVER () AS max_num
    FROM (
        SELECT requester_id AS id FROM RequestAccepted
        UNION ALL
        SELECT accepter_id AS id FROM RequestAccepted
    ) AS AllFriends
    GROUP BY id
)
SELECT id, num
FROM FriendCounts
WHERE num = max_num;
```

## Alternative Approaches Comparison

### Approach 1: Self-Join Method
```sql
SELECT 
    person AS id,
    COUNT(*) AS num
FROM (
    SELECT requester_id AS person, accepter_id AS friend FROM RequestAccepted
    UNION
    SELECT accepter_id AS person, requester_id AS friend FROM RequestAccepted
) AS Friendships
GROUP BY person
ORDER BY num DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

### Approach 2: CASE Statement Method
```sql
WITH AllRelations AS (
    SELECT 
        user_id,
        SUM(
            CASE WHEN user_id = requester_id THEN 1 ELSE 0 END +
            CASE WHEN user_id = accepter_id THEN 1 ELSE 0 END
        ) AS friend_count
    FROM (
        SELECT DISTINCT requester_id AS user_id FROM RequestAccepted
        UNION 
        SELECT DISTINCT accepter_id AS user_id FROM RequestAccepted
    ) Users
    CROSS JOIN RequestAccepted
    WHERE user_id = requester_id OR user_id = accepter_id
    GROUP BY user_id
)
SELECT user_id AS id, friend_count AS num
FROM AllRelations
ORDER BY friend_count DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

### Current Solution Advantages
```sql
# ✅ Simple and easy to understand
# ✅ Efficient UNION ALL usage
# ✅ Minimal query structure
# ✅ High maintainability
```

## Performance Considerations

### Index Optimization
```sql
-- Indexes on requester_id, accepter_id
CREATE INDEX idx_requester ON RequestAccepted(requester_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_accepter ON RequestAccepted(accepter_id);
```

### Large Dataset Optimization
```sql
-- Using CTE to reuse subquery
WITH AllFriendships AS (
    SELECT requester_id AS id FROM RequestAccepted
    UNION ALL
    SELECT accepter_id AS id FROM RequestAccepted
)
SELECT id, COUNT(*) AS num
FROM AllFriendships
GROUP BY id
ORDER BY num DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

## Debugging and Validation

### Step-by-Step Query Testing
```sql
-- Step 1: Test UNION ALL subquery
SELECT requester_id AS id FROM RequestAccepted
UNION ALL
SELECT accepter_id AS id FROM RequestAccepted;

-- Step 2: Test GROUP BY and COUNT
SELECT id, COUNT(*) AS num
FROM (
    SELECT requester_id AS id FROM RequestAccepted
    UNION ALL
    SELECT accepter_id AS id FROM RequestAccepted
) AS AllFriends
GROUP BY id;

-- Step 3: Test final ordering
SELECT id, COUNT(*) AS num
FROM (
    SELECT requester_id AS id FROM RequestAccepted
    UNION ALL
    SELECT accepter_id AS id FROM RequestAccepted
) AS AllFriends
GROUP BY id
ORDER BY num DESC;
```

### Verification Query
```sql
-- Manually verify person 3's friends
SELECT DISTINCT
    CASE 
        WHEN requester_id = 3 THEN accepter_id
        WHEN accepter_id = 3 THEN requester_id
    END AS friend_id
FROM RequestAccepted
WHERE requester_id = 3 OR accepter_id = 3;
-- Expected result: 1, 2, 4 (3 friends)
```

5. **Performance optimization** through proper indexing is crucial for large datasets

This problem demonstrates a fundamental pattern in social network analysis and showcases the power of SQL for handling bidirectional relationship data efficiently.

## Answer to Your Question

**Why can we use `ORDER BY num DESC`?**
- **Reason**: The `COUNT(*) AS num` in the SELECT clause creates the `num` column alias
- **AllFriends subquery does NOT have num column**: Correct understanding!
- **SQL execution order**: FROM → GROUP BY → SELECT (alias creation) → ORDER BY (alias usage)
- **Key insight**: ORDER BY can reference aliases created in the SELECT clause, even though the original subquery doesn't contain those columns

Your solution elegantly handles the bidirectional nature of friendships and demonstrates excellent understanding of SQL alias scoping rules!

# 1657\. Determine if Two Strings Are Close - Solution Explanation

## Problem Overview

You are given two strings, `word1` and `word2`. The goal is to determine if they are "close." Two strings are considered close if you can transform one into the other using a combination of two specific operations as many times as you want.

**The Allowed Operations:**

1.  **Operation 1 (Swap Characters)**: You can swap the position of any two characters in a string.
      - Example: `abcde` -\> `aecdb`
2.  **Operation 2 (Transform Characters)**: You can choose two existing characters and swap *all* of their occurrences.
      - Example: `aacabb` -\> `bbcbaa` (all `'a'`s become `'b'`s and all `'b'`s become `'a'`s).

**Examples:**

```python
Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "bca"
Output: true
# You can use Operation 1 to rearrange "abc" into "bca".

Input: word1 = "a", word2 = "aa"
Output: false
# The lengths are different, so no operations can make them equal.

Input: word1 = "cabbba", word2 = "abbccc"
Output: true
# The operations allow us to match their underlying structure.
```

## Key Insights

The core of this problem is to understand what properties of a string are preserved or changed by these operations.

  * **What does Operation 1 (Swap) mean?**
    If you can swap any two characters an unlimited number of times, you can arrange the characters in any order you want. This means the **order of characters does not matter**. However, the **count of each character** (the frequency) must be the same. This is the definition of an anagram.

  * **What does Operation 2 (Transform) mean?**
    This operation lets you "re-label" the characters. For `cabbba`, the frequencies are `{'c': 1, 'a': 2, 'b': 3}`. If we transform all `'b'`s and `'c'`s, the string might become `b` `a` `c` `c` `c` `a`. The frequencies are now `{'b': 1, 'a': 2, 'c': 3}`. The *character* associated with a count can change, but the **set of frequency numbers themselves remains the same**. The "inventory" of counts `{1, 2, 3}` is preserved.

### The Two Conditions for "Close" Strings

Combining these insights, two strings are "close" if and only if they satisfy two conditions:

1.  **They must have the same set of unique characters.** Neither operation can introduce a new character type (like a 'd') or remove an existing character type entirely.
2.  **They must have the same frequency "signature."** The collection of character counts must be the same for both strings. For example, if one string has counts of `[1, 2, 3]`, the other must also have counts of `[1, 2, 3]`, even if they correspond to different letters.

## Solution Approach

This solution directly checks the two conditions derived from our insights. It's a highly efficient approach that uses sets and frequency maps (`collections.Counter`).

```python
import collections
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def closeStrings(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> bool:
        # Pre-check: Operations do not change length. If lengths are different,
        # they can never be close.
        if len(word1) != len(word2):
            return False
            
        # Condition 1: Check if both strings use the same set of unique characters.
        if set(word1) != set(word2):
            return False
            
        # Condition 2: Check if the frequency signatures are the same.
        # Step 2a: Create frequency maps for both words.
        counts1 = collections.Counter(word1)
        counts2 = collections.Counter(word2)
        
        # Step 2b: Compare the sorted lists of their frequency values.
        return sorted(counts1.values()) == sorted(counts2.values())
```

## Detailed Code Analysis

### Step 1: The Length Check

```python
if len(word1) != len(word2):
    return False
```

  - This is a simple but important first step. Both allowed operations preserve the length of the string. If the lengths are different, it's impossible to make them equal. This is a quick exit for an obvious case.

### Step 2: The Character Set Check

```python
if set(word1) != set(word2):
    return False
```

  - This is our check for **Condition 1**.
  - `set(word1)` creates a collection containing only the unique characters from `word1` (e.g., `set("cabbba")` becomes `{'c', 'a', 'b'}`).
  - By comparing the two sets, we ensure that both strings are built from the exact same "alphabet" of characters.

### Step 3: The Frequency Signature Check

```python
counts1 = collections.Counter(word1)
counts2 = collections.Counter(word2)
```

  - `collections.Counter()` is a specialized dictionary that efficiently creates a frequency map. For `word1 = "cabbba"`, `counts1` becomes `{'c': 1, 'a': 2, 'b': 3}`.

<!-- end list -->

```python
return sorted(counts1.values()) == sorted(counts2.values())
```

  - This is the clever check for **Condition 2**.
  - `counts1.values()`: This extracts just the frequencies from the map into a list-like object. For `counts1`, this would be `[1, 2, 3]`.
  - `sorted(...)`: We sort this list of frequencies. This is crucial because Operation 2 allows us to swap which character gets which frequency, so the order of the counts doesn't matter, only the collection of counts itself.
  - `... == ...`: Finally, we compare the two sorted lists of frequencies. If they are identical, it means both strings have the same "frequency signature," and they are close.

## Step-by-Step Execution Trace

Let's trace the algorithm for `word1 = "cabbba"`, `word2 = "abbccc"` with extreme detail.

| Step | Code Being Executed | `word1` Result | `word2` Result | Comparison | Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | `len(word1) != len(word2)` | `6` | `6` | `6 != 6` | **False**. The code continues. |
| **2** | `set(word1) != set(word2)` | `{'c', 'a', 'b'}` | `{'a', 'b', 'c'}` | The sets are equal. `!=` is **False**. The code continues. |
| **3** | `collections.Counter(...)` | `{'c': 1, 'a': 2, 'b': 3}` | `{'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}` | - | - |
| **4** | `...values()` | `dict_values([1, 2, 3])` | `dict_values([1, 2, 3])` | - | - |
| **5** | `sorted(...)` | `[1, 2, 3]` | `[1, 2, 3]` | - | - |
| **6** | `return sorted(...) == sorted(...)` | `[1, 2, 3]` | `[1, 2, 3]` | `[1, 2, 3] == [1, 2, 3]` is **True**. | **Return `True`** |

## Performance Analysis

### Time Complexity: O(n)

  - Where `n` is the length of the strings.
  - `len()`, `set()`, and `collections.Counter()` all take `O(n)` time.
  - Sorting the frequencies (`.values()`) is very fast. The number of unique characters is at most 26 (a small constant, `k`). Sorting these `k` values takes `O(k log k)`, which is constant time and does not depend on `n`.
  - Therefore, the overall complexity is dominated by the initial `O(n)` scans.

### Space Complexity: O(1)

  - The space required for the sets and counters depends only on the number of unique characters in the alphabet (at most 26 for lowercase English letters). This is constant space and does not grow with the length `n` of the strings.

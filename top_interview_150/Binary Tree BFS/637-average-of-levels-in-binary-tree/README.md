# 637. Average of Levels in Binary Tree - Solution Explanation

## Problem Overview
Given the root of a binary tree, return the average value of the nodes on each level in the form of an array. Answers within 10^-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.

**Examples:**
```
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: [3.00000,14.50000,11.00000]
Explanation:
Level 0: 3 → average = 3.0
Level 1: 9, 20 → average = (9+20)/2 = 14.5
Level 2: 15, 7 → average = (15+7)/2 = 11.0
```

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 10^4]
- -2^31 <= Node.val <= 2^31 - 1

## Understanding the Problem

### Binary Tree Level Traversal
**Level-order traversal (BFS: Breadth-First Search)** is used to explore the tree from top to bottom, left to right.

**Visual Example:**
```
      3        ← Level 0 (average: 3.0)
     / \
    9   20     ← Level 1 (average: 14.5)
       /  \
      15   7   ← Level 2 (average: 11.0)
```

### Processing Each Level
1. **Level Identification**: Group nodes at the same depth
2. **Sum Calculation**: Calculate the sum of all node values at that level
3. **Average Calculation**: sum ÷ number of nodes = average
4. **Result Storage**: Store each level's average in an array

## Algorithm: BFS (Breadth-First Search)

**Core Idea:**
- Use a **Queue** to process nodes level by level
- Process each level completely before moving to the next
- Use `collections.deque` for efficient queue operations

**Queue Operation:**
```
Queue: [node] → dequeue from front → enqueue children to back
```

## Step-by-Step Algorithm Breakdown

### Step 1: Initialization and Edge Case Handling
```python
if not root:
    return []

averages = []
queue = collections.deque([root])
```

#### Understanding `collections.deque([root])`

**What is `collections.deque`?**
- `deque` stands for "double-ended queue"
- It's a data structure that allows efficient insertion and deletion from both ends
- More efficient than regular Python lists for queue operations

**Why `[root]` instead of just `root`?**
```python
# ❌ Wrong: This would cause an error
queue = collections.deque(root)  # TypeError: TreeNode is not iterable

# ✅ Correct: Pass a list containing the root node
queue = collections.deque([root])  # Creates deque with one element: the root node
```

**Detailed Explanation:**
- `collections.deque()` expects an **iterable** (like a list, tuple, or string)
- A `TreeNode` object is **not iterable** - you can't loop through it
- `[root]` creates a **list containing one element** (the root node)
- This list is iterable, so `deque()` can process it and create a queue with the root as the first element

**Visual Representation:**
```python
root = TreeNode(3)
# root is a single TreeNode object

[root] = [TreeNode(3)]
# [root] is a list containing one TreeNode object

queue = collections.deque([TreeNode(3)])
# queue is now a deque containing one TreeNode object
```

### Step 2: Level-by-Level Processing Loop
```python
while queue:
    level_sum = 0
    level_size = len(queue)
```
**Key Point:**
- `len(queue)` captures the number of nodes at the current level
- At this moment, the queue contains only nodes from the current level

### Step 3: Process All Nodes in Current Level
```python
for _ in range(level_size):
    node = queue.popleft()
    level_sum += node.val
    
    if node.left:
        queue.append(node.left)
    if node.right:
        queue.append(node.right)
```

#### Understanding the Underscore `_` in `for _ in range(level_size):`

**What does `_` mean?**
- `_` (underscore) is a **convention** in Python for "throwaway" or "dummy" variables
- It means "I need to loop this many times, but I don't care about the loop counter value"
- It's **not a special operator** - it's just a regular variable name that we choose to ignore

**Comparison with regular for loops:**
```python
# When you NEED the loop counter:
for i in range(5):
    print(f"Processing item {i}")  # i is used in the loop body

# When you DON'T NEED the loop counter:
for _ in range(5):
    print("Processing item")  # We just want to repeat 5 times
```

**In our algorithm:**
```python
for _ in range(level_size):
    node = queue.popleft()  # We don't need to know "this is the 1st, 2nd, 3rd node"
    level_sum += node.val   # We just need to process each node once
```

**Why `_` doesn't appear later in the code:**
- Because we **intentionally ignore** the loop counter
- We're using the loop purely for **repetition** (process exactly `level_size` nodes)
- The actual node data comes from `queue.popleft()`, not from the loop counter

**Alternative ways to write the same loop:**
```python
# Method 1: Using _ (recommended - shows intent clearly)
for _ in range(level_size):
    node = queue.popleft()

# Method 2: Using i but ignoring it (less clear)
for i in range(level_size):
    node = queue.popleft()  # i is never used

# Method 3: Using while loop (more verbose)
count = 0
while count < level_size:
    node = queue.popleft()
    count += 1
```

### Step 4: Calculate and Store Level Average
```python
averages.append(level_sum / level_size)
```
**Result:** Add the average value of this level to the result array

### Step 5: Return Final Result
```python
return averages
```

## Detailed Example Walkthrough

**Input:** 
```
      3
     / \
    9   20
       /  \
      15   7
```

### Initial State
```
queue: deque([TreeNode(3)])
averages: []
level_sum: 0
```

### Level 0 Processing (Node: 3)
```
level_size = 1 (queue contains only node 3)
level_sum = 0

Iteration 1 (_ = 0, but we don't use this value):
  node = TreeNode(3) (dequeued from front)
  level_sum = 0 + 3 = 3
  Add children 9, 20 to queue
  
queue: deque([TreeNode(9), TreeNode(20)])
level_sum = 3
average = 3/1 = 3.0
averages: [3.0]
```

### Level 1 Processing (Nodes: 9, 20)
```
level_size = 2 (queue contains nodes 9, 20)
level_sum = 0

Iteration 1 (_ = 0, ignored):
  node = TreeNode(9) (dequeued from front)
  level_sum = 0 + 9 = 9
  Node 9 has no children
  
Iteration 2 (_ = 1, ignored):
  node = TreeNode(20) (dequeued from front)
  level_sum = 9 + 20 = 29
  Add children 15, 7 to queue

queue: deque([TreeNode(15), TreeNode(7)])
level_sum = 29
average = 29/2 = 14.5
averages: [3.0, 14.5]
```

### Level 2 Processing (Nodes: 15, 7)
```
level_size = 2 (queue contains nodes 15, 7)
level_sum = 0

Iteration 1 (_ = 0, ignored):
  node = TreeNode(15) (dequeued from front)
  level_sum = 0 + 15 = 15
  Node 15 has no children
  
Iteration 2 (_ = 1, ignored):
  node = TreeNode(7) (dequeued from front)
  level_sum = 15 + 7 = 22
  Node 7 has no children

queue: deque([]) (empty)
level_sum = 22
average = 22/2 = 11.0
averages: [3.0, 14.5, 11.0]
```

### Final Result
```
queue: deque([]) (empty, so while loop ends)
return [3.0, 14.5, 11.0]
```

### Level-by-Level Processing Table

| Level | Nodes | Queue State (Start) | Level Sum | Node Count | Average | Queue State (End) |
|-------|-------|---------------------|-----------|------------|---------|-------------------|
| 0 | [1] | deque([1]) | 1 | 1 | 1.0 | deque([2,3]) |
| 1 | [2,3] | deque([2,3]) | 2+3=5 | 2 | 2.5 | deque([4,5,6]) |
| 2 | [4,5,6] | deque([4,5,6]) | 4+5+6=15 | 3 | 5.0 | deque([7]) |
| 3 | [7] | deque([7]) | 7 | 1 | 7.0 | deque([]) |

### Final Result
```
averages = [1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 7.0]
```

## Queue State Visualization

### Processing Flow
```
Initial:   queue = deque([1])
          ↓ Process Level 0
Level 1:   queue = deque([2, 3])
          ↓ Process Level 1  
Level 2:   queue = deque([4, 5, 6])
          ↓ Process Level 2
Level 3:   queue = deque([7])
          ↓ Process Level 3
End:       queue = deque([])
```

## Key Algorithm Insights

### 1. Why BFS is Suitable?
```python
# DFS (Depth-First Search) makes it difficult to 
# process nodes at the same level simultaneously

# BFS (Breadth-First Search) naturally processes level by level
while queue:  # Each iteration processes exactly one complete level
    level_size = len(queue)  # Number of nodes at current level
    # ... process all nodes in this level
```

### 2. Why Pre-capturing Level Size is Critical
```python
# ❌ Wrong: Level boundaries get mixed up
while queue:
    for i in range(len(queue)):  # len(queue) changes during processing!
        node = queue.popleft()
        # Adding children changes len(queue)
        
# ✅ Correct: Fix the level size before processing
while queue:
    level_size = len(queue)  # Capture fixed value
    for _ in range(level_size):  # Process exactly this many nodes
        node = queue.popleft()
```

### 3. Efficiency of collections.deque
```python
# Why we use collections.deque:
# - popleft(): O(1) time to remove from front
# - append(): O(1) time to add to back

# Problems with regular list:
# - pop(0): O(n) time (shifts all elements)
# - append(): O(1) time
```

### 4. Average Calculation Precision
```python
# Integer division vs float division
averages.append(level_sum / level_size)  # Automatically converts to float
```

## Alternative Approaches Comparison

### Approach 1: Recursive DFS (Less Efficient)
```python
def averageOfLevels(self, root):
    levels = {}  # level -> [list of values]
    
    def dfs(node, level):
        if not node:
            return
        if level not in levels:
            levels[level] = []
        levels[level].append(node.val)
        dfs(node.left, level + 1)
        dfs(node.right, level + 1)
    
    dfs(root, 0)
    return [sum(values) / len(values) for values in levels.values()]
```
**Problems:**
- Requires additional dictionary structure (less space efficient)
- Need to manually manage level information

### Approach 2: Level-by-Level Lists (High Memory Usage)
```python
def averageOfLevels(self, root):
    if not root:
        return []
    
    result = []
    current_level = [root]
    
    while current_level:
        level_sum = sum(node.val for node in current_level)
        result.append(level_sum / len(current_level))
        
        next_level = []
        for node in current_level:
            if node.left:
                next_level.append(node.left)
            if node.right:
                next_level.append(node.right)
        current_level = next_level
    
    return result
```
**Problems:**
- Creates new lists for each level (higher memory usage)

### Current Solution Advantages (BFS + deque)
```python
def averageOfLevels(self, root):
    if not root:
        return []
    
    averages = []
    queue = collections.deque([root])
    
    while queue:
        level_sum = 0
        level_size = len(queue)
        
        for _ in range(level_size):
            node = queue.popleft()
            level_sum += node.val
            
            if node.left:
                queue.append(node.left)
            if node.right:
                queue.append(node.right)
        
        averages.append(level_sum / level_size)
    
    return averages
```

**Advantages:**
- ✅ **Time Efficiency**: O(n) - visit each node exactly once
- ✅ **Space Efficiency**: O(w) - w is maximum width of tree (usually < O(n))
- ✅ **Implementation Simplicity**: Easy to understand and less prone to bugs
- ✅ **Memory Efficiency**: Reuses queue, avoids unnecessary memory allocation

## Time & Space Complexity Analysis

### Current Solution
- **Time Complexity**: **O(n)** where n = number of nodes in tree
  - Visit each node exactly once
  - Queue operations (popleft, append) are each O(1)
  - Total O(n) operations

- **Space Complexity**: **O(w)** where w = maximum width of tree
  - Queue simultaneously stores at most the maximum width of nodes
  - Complete binary tree: O(n/2) = O(n)
  - Chain-like tree: O(1)
  - Average case: O(log n)

### Complexity Comparison Table
| Approach | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Implementation | Notes |
|----------|-----------------|------------------|----------------|-------|
| **BFS + deque** | **O(n)** | **O(w)** | ✅ Simple | **Optimal** |
| DFS + Dictionary | O(n) | O(n) | ❌ Complex | Extra structure |
| Level Lists | O(n) | O(n) | ⚠️ Medium | Memory inefficient |

## Edge Cases Handled

### Single Node
```python
root = TreeNode(42)
# queue: deque([42]) → averages: [42.0] → return [42.0]
```

### Completely Left-Skewed Tree
```python
    1
   /
  2
 /
3

Level 0: [1] → average: 1.0
Level 1: [2] → average: 2.0  
Level 2: [3] → average: 3.0
Result: [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]
```

### Completely Right-Skewed Tree
```python
1
 \
  2
   \
    3

Level 0: [1] → average: 1.0
Level 1: [2] → average: 2.0
Level 2: [3] → average: 3.0  
Result: [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]
```

### Complete Binary Tree
```python
      1
     / \
    2   3
   / \ / \
  4 5 6 7

Level 0: [1] → 1/1 = 1.0
Level 1: [2,3] → 5/2 = 2.5
Level 2: [4,5,6,7] → 22/4 = 5.5
Result: [1.0, 2.5, 5.5]
```

### Empty Tree
```python
root = None
# First if statement returns []
```

## Common Implementation Mistakes and Solutions

### 1. Level Size Capture Timing
```python
# ❌ Wrong: Queue size changes during loop
while queue:
    level_sum = 0
    for i in range(len(queue)):  # Dangerous!
        node = queue.popleft()
        # append operations change len(queue)

# ✅ Correct: Pre-capture the size
while queue:
    level_sum = 0
    level_size = len(queue)  # Store as fixed value
    for _ in range(level_size):
        node = queue.popleft()
```

### 2. Child Node Existence Check
```python  
# ❌ Wrong: Adding None to queue
if node.left:
    queue.append(node.left)
else:
    queue.append(None)  # Dangerous!

# ✅ Correct: Only add existing children
if node.left:
    queue.append(node.left)
if node.right:
    queue.append(node.right)
```

### 3. Average Calculation with Integer Division
```python
# ❌ Caution: Integer division (though Python 3's / is automatically float)
averages.append(level_sum // level_size)  # Integer division

# ✅ Correct: Float division
averages.append(level_sum / level_size)  # Float division
```

### 4. Missing Empty Tree Check
```python
# ❌ Wrong: No empty check
def averageOfLevels(self, root):
    averages = []
    queue = collections.deque([root])  # Problem if root is None

# ✅ Correct: Check for empty tree first
def averageOfLevels(self, root):
    if not root:
        return []
    # ... rest of processing
```

            if node.left:
                queue.append(node.left)
            if node.right:

        # Level data processing (problem dependent)
        result.append(process_level_data(level_data))
    
    return result
```

# 190\. Reverse Bits - Solution Explanation

## Problem Overview

Given a 32-bit unsigned integer, reverse the order of its bits and return the new integer.

**Bit Reversal Definition:**
The process involves taking the binary representation of the input number, treating it as a string of 32 characters (0s and 1s), reversing that string, and then converting the new binary string back into an integer.

**Examples:**

```
Input: n = 43261596
Binary: 00000010100101000001111010011100
Reversed: 00111001011110000010100101000000
Output: 964176192
```

## Key Insights

### Bit-by-Bit Construction

The most direct way to solve this is to build the reversed number one bit at a time. The core idea is to:

1.  Take the **last** bit from the input number `n`.
2.  Place it at the **end** of our `result` number.
3.  Repeat this process 32 times.

To place a bit at the end of the `result`, we first need to make space for it. We do this by shifting all existing bits in `result` one position to the left.

## Solution Approach

Our solution will iterate 32 times, once for each bit, and use bitwise operators to efficiently build the reversed integer.

```python
class Solution:
    def reverseBits(self, n: int) -> int:
        result = 0
        
        for i in range(32):
            # 1. Shift result to the left to make space
            result <<= 1
            
            # 2. Get the last bit of n
            last_bit = n & 1
            
            # 3. Add the last bit to the result
            result |= last_bit
            
            # 4. Discard the last bit of n
            n >>= 1
            
        return result
```

**Strategy:**

1.  **Initialization**: Start with a `result` of 0.
2.  **Iteration**: Loop 32 times.
3.  **Manipulation**: In each loop, get the last bit from `n` and add it to the `result`.
4.  **Update**: Shift `n` to expose the next bit for the next iteration.

## Detailed Code Analysis

### Step 1: Initialization

```python
result = 0
```

  - We start with an empty canvas. This integer will accumulate the bits from `n` in reverse order.

### Step 2: The Loop

```python
for i in range(32):
```

  - This ensures we process all 32 bits, which is crucial. A `while n > 0` loop would fail for inputs where the most significant bits are 0.

### Step 3: Shifting the Result

```python
result <<= 1
```

  - The left shift operator `<<` moves all bits in `result` one position to the left, adding a `0` at the end. This makes space for the next bit we're about to add.

### Step 4: Getting the Last Bit

```python
last_bit = n & 1
```

  - The bitwise `AND` operator `&` with `1` is a standard trick to isolate the least significant bit (LSB). If the last bit of `n` is 1, `n & 1` is 1. If it's 0, `n & 1` is 0.

### Step 5: Adding the Bit

```python
result |= last_bit
```

  - The bitwise `OR` operator `|` is used to set the last bit of `result` (which is currently `0` from the left shift) to the `last_bit` we just extracted.

### Step 6: Updating the Input

```python
n >>= 1
```

  - The right shift operator `>>` moves all bits in `n` one position to the right, effectively discarding the last bit we just processed.

## Step-by-Step Execution Trace

### Example: 4-bit reversal of `n = 13` (binary `1101`)

| Iteration | `n` (binary) | `last_bit` (`n & 1`) | result (before \|=) | result (after \|=) | `n` (after `>>= 1`) |
|----------|---------------|----------------------|---------------------|--------------------|---------------------|
| **Start** | `1101` |  | `0000` | `0000` | `1101` |
| **1** | `1101` | 1 | `0000 << 1` -> `0000` | `0001` | `0110` |
| **2** | `0110` | 0 | `0001 << 1` -> `0010` | `0010` | `0011` |
| **3** | `0011` | 1 | `0010 << 1` -> `0100` | `0101` | `0001` |
| **4** | `0001` | 1 | `0101 << 1` -> `1010` | `1011` | `0000` |

  - After 4 iterations, the final `result` is `1011` in binary, which is **11** in decimal. This is the correct reverse of `1101`.

## Performance Analysis

### Time Complexity: O(1)

  - The loop runs a fixed 32 times, regardless of the size of the input number `n`. Therefore, the time complexity is constant.

### Space Complexity: O(1)

  - We only use a few variables (`result`, `i`, `last_bit`) to store the state. The space required is constant and does not depend on the input size.

## Alternative Approaches Comparison

### Approach 1: Bitwise Manipulation (Our Solution)

  - ✅ O(1) time and O(1) space.
  - ✅ Most efficient and language-agnostic.
  - ✅ Demonstrates a fundamental understanding of computer arithmetic.

### Approach 2: String Conversion

```python
# Less optimal solution
bin_str = format(n, '032b')
reversed_str = bin_str[::-1]
return int(reversed_str, 2)
```

  - ✅ Simple to read and write.
  - ❌ Less efficient due to conversions and string memory allocation.
  - ❌ Fails to demonstrate bit manipulation skills, which is often the point of such problems in interviews.

## Key Learning Points

  - How to process an integer one bit at a time.
  - The purpose and use of bitwise operators: `<<` (left shift), `>>` (right shift), `&` (AND), and `|` (OR).
  - The common pattern of building a new number by repeatedly shifting and adding bits.

## Real-World Applications

  - **Hardware/Driver Programming**: Directly manipulating hardware registers.

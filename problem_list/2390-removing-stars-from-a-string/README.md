# 2390\. Removing Stars From a String - Solution Explanation

## Problem Overview

You are given a string `s` that contains lowercase English letters and stars (`*`). The task is to process this string according to a specific rule and return the final string.

**The Operation:**
When you encounter a star (`*`), you must perform one operation:

1.  Find the closest non-star character to the **left** of the star.
2.  Remove that character.
3.  Remove the star itself.

The problem guarantees that this operation will always be possible (i.e., there will always be a character to the left of a star to remove).

**Example:**

```python
Input: s = "leet**cod*e"
Output: "lecoe"
Explanation:
1. Start with "leet**cod*e". The first '*' removes 't'. String becomes "lee*cod*e".
2. Now at the second '*'. It removes 'e'. String becomes "lecod*e".
3. Now at the third '*'. It removes 'd'. String becomes "lecoe".
4. No more stars, so this is the final result.
```

## Key Insights

### Last-In, First-Out (LIFO)

The key insight comes from analyzing the rule: "remove the closest non-star character to its left."

Imagine you are building the result string from left to right. When you see a normal character, you add it to your result.

  - `l` -\> result is `l`
  - `e` -\> result is `le`
  - `e` -\> result is `lee`
  - `t` -\> result is `leet`

Now, when you see a `*`, which character does it remove? It removes the `'t'`, which was the **last character you added**.
If you see another `*`, it removes the `'e'`, which was the *new* last character you added.

This behavior—where the last item added is the first item to be removed—is famously known as **Last-In, First-Out (LIFO)**. The perfect data structure for managing a LIFO process is a **stack**.

## Solution Approach

This solution uses a list to simulate a stack. We iterate through the input string. If we see a normal character, we push it onto the stack. If we see a star, we pop from the stack.

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def removeStars(self, s: str) -> str:
        # We will use a list to function as a stack.
        # It will hold the characters of our final, processed string.
        stack = []
        
        # Iterate through each character of the input string from left to right.
        for char in s:
            # If the character is a star...
            if char == '*':
                # ...it removes the last character we added. This is a "pop" operation.
                # The problem guarantees the operation is always possible,
                # so we don't need to check if the stack is empty.
                stack.pop()
            # If the character is a normal letter...
            else:
                # ...we add it to our result. This is a "push" operation.
                stack.append(char)
                
        # After the loop, the stack contains the correct final characters in order.
        # We join them together to form the result string.
        return "".join(stack)
```

**Strategy:**

1.  **Initialize Stack**: Create an empty list `stack` to store the characters of the final string.
2.  **Iterate**: Loop through each `char` in the input string `s`.
3.  **Push or Pop**:
      - If `char` is a letter, **push** it onto the stack (`stack.append(char)`).
      - If `char` is a star, **pop** the last element from the stack (`stack.pop()`).
4.  **Join**: After the loop, the `stack` contains all the characters of the final string in the correct order. Use `"".join(stack)` to convert the list of characters back into a single string.

## Detailed Code Analysis

### Step 1: Initialization

```python
stack = []
```

  - We create an empty list. In Python, lists have efficient methods for adding to the end (`append`) and removing from the end (`pop`), which makes them perfect for use as a stack.

### Step 2: The Loop

```python
for char in s:
```

  - This starts a single, linear pass through the input string `s`, looking at each character one by one.

### Step 3: The `if/else` Logic

```python
if char == '*':
    stack.pop()
else:
    stack.append(char)
```

  - This is the core logic that processes each character.
  - **`if char == '*'`**: If the character is a star, we perform the "remove" operation. `stack.pop()` in Python removes the last item from the list. This is a very fast `O(1)` operation.
  - **`else`**: If the character is not a star, it's a letter we want to keep. `stack.append(char)` adds the character to the end of the list. This is also a fast `O(1)` operation.

### Step 4: The Final Result

```python
return "".join(stack)
```

  - After the loop has processed all characters in `s`, the `stack` list contains exactly the characters that should be in the final string, in the correct order.
  - `"".join(stack)` is an efficient Python method to concatenate all the strings in the `stack` list into a single new string, with an empty string (`""`) as the separator.

## Step-by-Step Execution Trace

Let's trace the algorithm with the example `s = "leet**cod*e"` with extreme detail.

| `char` | `char == '*'`? | Action | `stack` State |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Start** | - | - | `[]` |
| **'l'** | False | `stack.append('l')` | `['l']` |
| **'e'** | False | `stack.append('e')` | `['l', 'e']` |
| **'e'** | False | `stack.append('e')` | `['l', 'e', 'e']` |
| **'t'** | False | `stack.append('t')` | `['l', 'e', 'e', 't']` |
| **'\*'** | True | `stack.pop()` (removes 't')| `['l', 'e', 'e']` |
| **'\*'** | True | `stack.pop()` (removes 'e')| `['l', 'e']` |
| **'c'** | False | `stack.append('c')` | `['l', 'e', 'c']` |
| **'o'** | False | `stack.append('o')` | `['l', 'e', 'c', 'o']` |
| **'d'** | False | `stack.append('d')` | `['l', 'e', 'c', 'o', 'd']`|
| **'\*'** | True | `stack.pop()` (removes 'd')| `['l', 'e', 'c', 'o']` |
| **'e'** | False | `stack.append('e')` | `['l', 'e', 'c', 'o', 'e']`|

  - The `for` loop finishes.
  - The function calls `"".join(['l', 'e', 'c', 'o', 'e'])`.
  - The final result returned is **`"lecoe"`**.

## Performance Analysis

### Time Complexity: O(n)

  - Where `n` is the length of the string `s`. We iterate through the string exactly once, and each operation inside the loop (`append` or `pop` on the end of a list) is an `O(1)` operation on average.

### Space Complexity: O(n)

  - In the worst-case scenario (a string with no stars), the stack will grow to the same size as the input string. Therefore, the space required is proportional to the length of the input.

## Key Learning Points

  - **Stack for LIFO**: This problem is a perfect example of a "Last-In, First-Out" (LIFO) process. Recognizing this pattern is key to choosing a stack as the right data structure.
  - **Python Lists as Stacks**: A standard Python `list` is an excellent and efficient way to implement a stack when you only need to add (`append`) and remove (`pop`) from the end.
  - **Building a Result**: Instead of complex string slicing or removal, building a new, clean result in a separate data structure (like our stack) is often a much simpler and more efficient strategy.

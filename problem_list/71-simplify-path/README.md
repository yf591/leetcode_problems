# 71\. Simplify Path - Solution Explanation

## Problem Overview

You are given an absolute Unix-style file path string. Your task is to convert it into its **simplified canonical path**.

**Canonical Path Rules:**

1.  Must start with a single slash `/`.
2.  Directories are separated by a single slash `/`.
3.  Must not end with a trailing slash (unless it's just the root `/`).
4.  Must resolve all `.` (current directory) and `..` (parent directory) components.
5.  Must treat multiple slashes `//` as a single slash.

**Examples:**

```python
Input: path = "/home/"
Output: "/home"

Input: path = "/home//foo/"
Output: "/home/foo"

Input: path = "/home/user/Documents/../Pictures"
Output: "/home/user/Pictures"

Input: path = "/../"
Output: "/"
```

## Key Insights

### The Nature of File Paths and Stacks

The key to this problem is to recognize the behavior of navigating a file system. When you move into a directory (`cd folder`), you are conceptually pushing that folder onto a "stack" of your current location. When you move up a level (`cd ..`), you are popping the last directory off that stack.

This **Last-In, First-Out (LIFO)** behavior is a perfect match for the **stack** data structure. We can process the path component by component, using a stack to build the final, valid directory structure.

### Deconstructing the Path

The first step is to break the raw path string into its fundamental components. The `/` character is the natural delimiter. Python's `path.split('/')` method is the perfect tool for this. It will turn a string like `"/home//foo/"` into a list of components: `['', 'home', '', 'foo', '']`. Once we have this list, we can process each component according to the rules.

## Solution Approach

This solution implements the stack-based strategy. It first splits the path string into components. Then, it iterates through these components, manipulating a stack to simulate the directory traversal. Finally, it joins the elements in the stack to construct the canonical path.

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def simplifyPath(self, path: str) -> str:
        # We use a list to simulate a stack. It will hold the names of the
        # directories in our final, valid path.
        stack = []
        
        # Step 1: Split the path by '/' to get all components.
        # e.g., "/home//foo/" -> ['', 'home', '', 'foo', '']
        components = path.split('/')
        
        # Step 2: Iterate through each component to process it.
        for component in components:
            # Case 1: If the component is '..', we need to go up one directory.
            if component == '..':
                # We can only go up if the stack is not empty (i.e., we are not at the root).
                if stack:
                    stack.pop() # This removes the last directory from our path.
            
            # Case 2: If the component is a valid directory name.
            # A valid name is not empty ('') and not the current directory ('.').
            elif component and component != '.':
                # We go down into this directory by pushing it onto our stack.
                stack.append(component)

            # Case 3 (Implicit): If the component is '' or '.', we do nothing.
            # This correctly handles cases like '//' and '/./'.

        # Step 3: Join the components in the stack to form the final path.
        # The result must always start with a single '/'.
        return "/" + "/".join(stack)
```

## Detailed Code Analysis

### Step 1: Splitting the Path

```python
components = path.split('/')
```

  - The `.split('/')` method is called on the input string `path`. It breaks the string into a list of substrings, using the `/` character as the delimiter.
  - **Crucially, it handles multiple slashes correctly.** For example, `"/home//foo/"` has a slash at the beginning, two slashes in the middle, and a slash at the end. This results in empty strings in the list where these slashes were.
  - **Example**: `path.split('/')` on `"/home//foo/"` results in the list `['', 'home', '', 'foo', '']`.

### Step 2: The Logic Inside the Loop

We iterate through each `component` in the list we just created.

**Case 1: The Parent Directory `..`**

```python
if component == '..':
    if stack:
        stack.pop()
```

  - This handles the "go up one level" command.
  - `stack.pop()`: In Python, `list.pop()` removes and returns the **last** item from a list. When a list is used as a stack, this is the "pop" operation.
  - `if stack:`: This is a safety check. It's shorthand for `if len(stack) > 0`. We can only pop from the stack if it's not empty. This correctly handles paths like `/../`, where trying to go up from the root directory does nothing.

**Case 2: A Valid Directory Name**

```python
elif component and component != '.':
    stack.append(component)
```

  - This handles a valid directory or file name (like `"home"`, `"foo"`, or even `"..."`).
  - `component`: This is a concise way to check if the string is not empty (`''`). An empty string evaluates to `False` in a boolean context.
  - `component != '.'`: This filters out the current directory command.
  - `stack.append(component)`: If the component is valid, we add it to the end of our list. When a list is used as a stack, this is the "push" operation.

**Case 3: Ignored Components**

  - The components `''` (from multiple or leading/trailing slashes) and `.` (current directory) do not match either of the `if/elif` conditions. The code simply does nothing and moves to the next component, correctly ignoring them.

### Step 3: Reconstructing the Final Path

```python
return "/" + "/".join(stack)
```

  - After the loop, the `stack` contains the clean, final sequence of directories. For example: `['home', 'user', 'Pictures']`.
  - `"/".join(stack)`: This is the reverse of the `split` operation. It takes the list of strings in the `stack` and joins them into a single string, using the `/` character as the "glue" between each element. The result would be `"home/user/Pictures"`.
  - `"/" + ...`: The problem states the canonical path must always start with a single `/`. We prepend this to our joined string to get the final result, e.g., `"/home/user/Pictures"`.

## Step-by-Step Execution Trace

Let's trace the algorithm with the example `path = "/a/./b/../../c/"` with extreme detail.

1.  **Initialization**:

      * `stack = []`
      * `components = path.split('/')` -\> `['', 'a', '.', 'b', '..', '..', 'c', '']`

2.  **The Loop**:

| `component` | `if == '..'`? | `elif valid?` | Action | `stack` State |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Start** | - | - | - | `[]` |
| **`''`** | False | False (`''` is not True)| Ignore. | `[]` |
| **`'a'`** | False | True | `stack.append('a')` | `['a']` |
| **`'.'`** | False | False (`!= '.'` is False)| Ignore. | `['a']` |
| **`'b'`** | False | True | `stack.append('b')` | `['a', 'b']` |
| **`'..'`** | True | - | `stack.pop()` (removes 'b')| `['a']` |
| **`'..'`** | True | - | `stack.pop()` (removes 'a')| `[]` |
| **`'c'`** | False | True | `stack.append('c')` | `['c']` |
| **`''`** | False | False | Ignore. | `['c']` |

3.  **Final Step**:
      * The loop finishes. `stack` is `['c']`.
      * The code executes `return "/" + "/".join(['c'])`.
      * `"/".join(['c'])` becomes `"c"`.
      * `"/" + "c"` becomes `"/c"`.
      * The function returns **`"/c"`**.

## Performance Analysis

### Time Complexity: O(n)

  - Where `n` is the length of the input `path` string.
  - `path.split('/')` takes `O(n)` time.
  - The `for` loop iterates through the components. Each component is processed in constant time (pushing or popping from the end of a list is `O(1)`). The total time for the loop is proportional to the number of components, which is at most `O(n)`.
  - The final `"/".join(stack)` operation also takes time proportional to the total length of the final path, which is at most `O(n)`.
  - The overall complexity is `O(n)`.

### Space Complexity: O(n)

  - The space required is determined by the `components` list and the `stack`. In the worst case (a long path with no `..` components), the stack can grow to a size proportional to the length of the input string.

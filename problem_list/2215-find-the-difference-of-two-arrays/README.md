# 2215\. Find the Difference of Two Arrays - Solution Explanation

## Problem Overview

You are given two integer arrays, `nums1` and `nums2`. The goal is to find the numbers that are unique to each array. The output must be a list containing two lists:

1.  The first list contains all the **distinct** numbers from `nums1` that are **not** present in `nums2`.
2.  The second list contains all the **distinct** numbers from `nums2` that are **not** present in `nums1`.

**Examples:**

```python
Input: nums1 = [1,2,3], nums2 = [2,4,6]
Output: [[1,3],[4,6]]
Explanation:
- 1 and 3 are in nums1 but not nums2.
- 4 and 6 are in nums2 but not nums1.

Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,3], nums2 = [1,1,2,2]
Output: [[3],[]]
Explanation:
- 3 is in nums1 but not nums2. (Note that the duplicate 3 is ignored).
- All numbers in nums2 (1 and 2) are present in nums1.
```

## Key Insights

### Sets are the Perfect Tool

This problem has two major clues in its description: **"distinct integers"** and finding the **"difference"** between two collections. These words are a huge hint that the `set` data structure is the ideal tool for the job.

Sets in Python have two powerful properties that directly solve our problem:

1.  **Uniqueness**: Sets automatically store only unique elements. Converting `[1, 2, 3, 3]` to a set results in `{1, 2, 3}`.
2.  **Difference Operation**: Sets have a built-in, highly optimized `-` operator that finds the elements present in one set but not another.

By leveraging sets, we can avoid writing complex loops to handle duplicates and find differences manually.

## Solution Approach

This solution is a direct translation of the insights above. It converts the input lists into sets and then uses the set difference operator to find the unique elements.

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def findDifference(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        # Step 1: Convert both lists to sets to get unique elements.
        set1 = set(nums1)
        set2 = set(nums2)
        
        # Step 2: Use the set difference operator (-) to find the unique elements.
        diff1 = list(set1 - set2)
        diff2 = list(set2 - set1)
        
        # Step 3: Return the two resulting lists.
        return [diff1, diff2]
```

**Strategy:**

1.  **Convert to Sets**: Transform `nums1` and `nums2` into `set1` and `set2`. This instantly handles the "distinct" requirement.
2.  **Calculate Differences**: Perform the `set1 - set2` and `set2 - set1` operations.
3.  **Format Output**: Convert the resulting difference sets back into lists and return them inside another list.

## Detailed Code Analysis

### Step 1: Conversion to Sets

```python
set1 = set(nums1)
set2 = set(nums2)
```

  - This is the crucial first step. `set(nums1)` iterates through `nums1`, creating a new `set` containing only the unique elements from the list. This is an `O(n)` operation, where `n` is the length of the list.

### Step 2: Set Difference

```python
diff1 = list(set1 - set2)
diff2 = list(set2 - set1)
```

  - `set1 - set2`: This is the core of the logic. The `-` operator is a special function for sets that returns a *new set* containing all the elements that are in `set1` but are **not** in `set2`.
  - `list(...)`: The result of the difference operation is a `set`. The problem requires the output to be a list of lists, so we convert this result set into a list.

### Step 3: The Final Result

```python
return [diff1, diff2]
```

  - This line simply places the two lists we created into a final container list, matching the required output format.

## Deep Dive: Python's `set` and its Operators

A `set` is an unordered collection of unique items. Think of it as a bag where you can put things, but if you try to put the same thing in twice, you still only have one of it. Sets are incredibly fast for checking if an item exists.

Sets have powerful operators that work like Venn diagrams. Let's say `set1 = {1, 2, 3}` and `set2 = {2, 3, 4}`.

### **Difference (`-`)**

  - **Meaning**: "What is in the first set that is NOT in the second set?"
  - **Code**: `set1 - set2`
  - **Result**: `{1}`
  - 
### **Union (`|`)**

  - **Meaning**: "Give me everything from both sets combined."
  - **Code**: `set1 | set2`
  - **Result**: `{1, 2, 3, 4}`
  - 
### **Intersection (`&`)**

  - **Meaning**: "Give me only the things that appear in BOTH sets."
  - **Code**: `set1 & set2`
  - **Result**: `{2, 3}`
  - 
## Step-by-Step Execution Trace

### Example: `nums1 = [1, 2, 3, 3]`, `nums2 = [1, 1, 2, 2]`

| Step | Operation | `set1` | `set2` | `diff1` | `diff2` | Explanation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | `set1 = set(nums1)` | `{1, 2, 3}` | - | - | - | Create `set1` from `[1,2,3,3]`. Duplicates are removed. |
| **2** | `set2 = set(nums2)` | `{1, 2, 3}` | `{1, 2}` | - | - | Create `set2` from `[1,1,2,2]`. Duplicates are removed. |
| **3** | `set1 - set2` | `{1, 2, 3}` | `{1, 2}` | `{3}` | - | Find what's in `set1` but not `set2`. The result is `{3}`. |
| **4** | `list(...)` | `{1, 2, 3}` | `{1, 2}` | `[3]` | - | Convert the result to a list. |
| **5** | `set2 - set1` | `{1, 2, 3}` | `{1, 2}` | `[3]` | `{}` | Find what's in `set2` but not `set1`. The result is an empty set. |
| **6** | `list(...)` | `{1, 2, 3}` | `{1, 2}` | `[3]` | `[]` | Convert the result to a list. |
| **7** | `return [diff1, diff2]` | - | - | - | - | The final result is `[[3], []]`. |

## Performance Analysis

### Time Complexity: O(m + n)

  - Where `m` and `n` are the lengths of `nums1` and `nums2`.
  - Converting `nums1` to `set1` takes `O(m)` time.
  - Converting `nums2` to `set2` takes `O(n)` time.
  - The set difference operations are very fast, on average proportional to the sizes of the sets.
  - The dominant operation is the initial conversion of lists to sets.

### Space Complexity: O(m + n)

  - In the worst case (if all elements are unique), `set1` will store `m` elements and `set2` will store `n` elements. The space required is proportional to the size of the inputs.

## Key Learning Points

  - Recognizing that problem descriptions with keywords like "distinct," "unique," "difference," or "intersection" are strong hints to use the `set` data structure.
  - Leveraging built-in data structures and their optimized operators (`-`, `|`, `&`) can lead to code that is much cleaner, more readable, and more efficient than manual loops.

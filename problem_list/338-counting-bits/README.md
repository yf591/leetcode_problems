# 338\. Counting Bits - Solution Explanation

## Problem Overview

You are given an integer `n`. The task is to create an array (or list) named `ans` of length `n + 1`. For each index `i` (from `0` to `n`), the value `ans[i]` should be the number of `1`s in the binary representation of `i`. This is also known as the "Hamming weight" or "population count."

**Examples:**

```python
Input: n = 2
Output: [0,1,1]
Explanation:
0 --> 0 (0 ones)
1 --> 1 (1 one)
2 --> 10 (1 one)

Input: n = 5
Output: [0,1,1,2,1,2]
Explanation:
0 --> 0    (0 ones)
1 --> 1    (1 one)
2 --> 10   (1 one)
3 --> 11   (2 ones)
4 --> 100  (1 one)
5 --> 101  (2 ones)
```

## Key Insights

### The Inefficient Approach vs. A Better Way

A straightforward approach is to loop from `0` to `n`, and for each number, convert it to a binary string and count the `'1'`s. While this works, it's inefficient (`O(n log n)` time) because you are solving each number's problem from scratch.

The key insight for a faster solution is to realize this is a **Dynamic Programming (DP)** problem. The answer for a number `i` can be quickly calculated if we already know the answers for smaller numbers.

### The Bitwise Relationship

The most elegant insight comes from looking at the relationship between a number `i` and the number `i / 2`.

  - In binary, dividing by 2 is the same as shifting all bits one position to the right (`>> 1`). This action effectively chops off the last bit.
  - This means the binary representation of `i` is just the binary of `i / 2` with one extra bit (the last bit of `i`) tacked on at the end.
  - Therefore, the number of `1`s in `i` must be: `(the number of 1's in i / 2) + (the value of the last bit of i)`.

This gives us a simple, powerful formula: `ans[i] = ans[i >> 1] + (i % 2)`.

## Solution Approach

This solution uses a bottom-up dynamic programming approach. It creates an array `ans` and fills it from `0` up to `n`, using the clever bitwise formula to calculate each new value based on a previously computed value.

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def countBits(self, n: int) -> List[int]:
        # Step 1: Initialize a DP array 'ans' of size n+1 with all zeros.
        # ans[0] is already correctly set to 0.
        ans = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        # Step 2: Iterate from 1 up to n to fill the array.
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            # Step 3: Apply the dynamic programming formula for each number.
            ans[i] = ans[i >> 1] + (i % 2)
            
        return ans
```

## Detailed Code Analysis

### Step 1: Initialization

```python
ans = [0] * (n + 1)
```

  - We create our "DP table," which is the array we will eventually return. It's sized `n + 1` to hold results for `0` through `n`.
  - We initialize it with zeros. The base case, `ans[0] = 0` (the number 0 has zero `1`s), is automatically handled.

### Step 2: The Loop

```python
for i in range(1, n + 1):
```

  - We loop from `1` up to `n` (inclusive). Inside this loop, we will calculate the answer for `ans[i]`.

### Step 3: The DP Formula

```python
ans[i] = ans[i >> 1] + (i % 2)
```

  - This is the core of the efficient solution, where all the magic happens. Let's break it down in extreme detail:
      - **`i >> 1` (Right Bit Shift)**: This is a bitwise operator that shifts all bits of `i` one position to the right. It's a very fast way to perform integer division by 2 (`i // 2`). For example, if `i` is `5` (binary `101`), `i >> 1` is `2` (binary `10`). It effectively chops off the last bit.
      - **`ans[i >> 1]`**: Since we are building our `ans` array in order, when we are at index `i`, the answer for the smaller number `i >> 1` has *already been computed* and stored. We simply look it up. This is the DP partâ€”reusing a previous result.
      - **`i % 2` (Modulo 2)**: This is a simple way to get the value of the last bit of `i`. If `i` is even, its last bit is `0`, and `i % 2` is `0`. If `i` is odd, its last bit is `1`, and `i % 2` is `1`.
      - **The `+`**: We add the two parts together. We take the bit count of the number *without its last bit* (`ans[i >> 1]`) and add the value of the *last bit itself* (`i % 2`). The sum is the total bit count for `i`.

## Step-by-Step Execution Trace

Let's trace the algorithm for `n = 5` with extreme detail.

1.  **Initialization**: `ans` = `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
2.  **The Loop**:

| `i` | `i` (binary) | `i >> 1` (i // 2) | `ans[i >> 1]` (Prev. Result) | `i % 2` (Last Bit)| `ans[i]` Calculation | `ans` Array State |
| :-- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Start** | - | - | - | - | - | `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` |
| **1** | `1` | 0 | `ans[0]` -\> 0 | 1 | `0 + 1 = 1` | `[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]` |
| **2** | `10` | 1 | `ans[1]` -\> 1 | 0 | `1 + 0 = 1` | `[0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]` |
| **3** | `11` | 1 | `ans[1]` -\> 1 | 1 | `1 + 1 = 2` | `[0, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0]` |
| **4** | `100`| 2 | `ans[2]` -\> 1 | 0 | `1 + 0 = 1` | `[0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0]` |
| **5** | `101`| 2 | `ans[2]` -\> 1 | 1 | `1 + 1 = 2` | `[0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2]` |

3.  **Final Step**: The loop finishes. The function returns the final `ans` array: **`[0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2]`**.

## Performance Analysis

### Time Complexity: O(n)

  - The algorithm iterates in a single loop from `1` to `n`. Each operation inside the loop is a constant-time operation.

### Space Complexity: O(n)

  - We are required by the problem to create and return an array of size `n + 1`. The space used is therefore proportional to the input `n`.

## Key Learning Points

  - **Dynamic Programming**: This is a perfect example of DP, where the solution to a problem (`ans[i]`) depends on the solution to a smaller, previously solved subproblem (`ans[i >> 1]`).
  - **Bit Manipulation**: It showcases how understanding the binary representation of numbers and using bitwise operators (`>>`) can lead to highly efficient and elegant solutions.
  - **Finding Patterns**: The key to solving many DP problems is to write out the first few answers and look for a mathematical or logical pattern that connects them.

# 169. Majority Element - Solution Explanation

## Problem Overview

Find the **majority element** in an array - the element that appears more than ⌊n/2⌋ times.

**Majority Element Definition:**
- **Frequency requirement**: Appears more than half the array length
- **Mathematical condition**: count > ⌊n/2⌋ where n = array length
- **Guarantee**: The majority element always exists in the given array

**Examples:**
```python
Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: 3
Explanation: Element 3 appears 2 times (2 > 3/2 = 1.5) ✓

Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
Output: 2
Explanation: Element 2 appears 4 times (4 > 7/2 = 3.5) ✓

Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1
Explanation: Single element is always majority ✓
```

## Key Insights

### Mathematical Property - The Core Insight
```python
# Critical Mathematical Insight:
# After sorting, the majority element MUST occupy the middle index
# This is guaranteed by the mathematical properties of majority elements

# Why this works:
# 1. Majority element appears > n/2 times
# 2. After sorting, identical elements are grouped together
# 3. Since majority element occupies more than half the array,
#    it must "pass through" or "contain" the middle index
```

### Sort + Middle Index Strategy
```python
# Two-step approach:
# Step 1: Sort the array → identical elements become consecutive
# Step 2: Access middle index → guaranteed to be majority element

# Visual proof:
# Any element appearing > n/2 times will span across the middle
# regardless of its position in the original array
```

### Why Middle Index Always Works
```python
# Mathematical proof:
# - Array length: n
# - Middle index: n // 2
# - Majority element count: > n/2
# - After sorting: majority elements form continuous block
# - This block MUST include index n//2 due to size constraint
```

## Solution Approach

Our solution uses **Sort + Middle Index Access** with mathematical guarantee:

```python
def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
    # First, sort the array
    nums.sort()

    # The majority element is guaranteed to be at the middle index
    # because it appears more than n/2 times.
    middle_index = len(nums) // 2

    return nums[middle_index]
```

**Strategy:**
1. **Array Sorting**: Group identical elements together using built-in sort
2. **Mathematical Property**: Leverage the fact that majority element spans middle
3. **Direct Access**: No need for counting - middle index is guaranteed correct
4. **Elegant Simplicity**: Just 3 lines of core logic

## Detailed Code Analysis

### Step 1: Array Sorting
```python
nums.sort()
```

**Sorting Purpose and Effect**:
```python
# Before sorting: Elements can be scattered
[3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 2] → Random distribution

# After sorting: Identical elements grouped together
[1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3] → Consecutive identical elements
```

**Why Sorting is Crucial**:
```python
# Sorting transforms the problem:
# From: "Find element with highest frequency"
# To: "Access the middle position of sorted array"

# The majority element forms the largest consecutive block
# This block must span the middle index due to its size (> n/2)
```

**Sorting Algorithm Details**:
```python
# Python's sort() method:
# - Uses Timsort algorithm (hybrid of merge sort and insertion sort)
# - Time complexity: O(n log n)
# - Space complexity: O(1) for in-place sorting
# - Stable: Preserves relative order of equal elements
```

### Step 2: Middle Index Calculation
```python
middle_index = len(nums) // 2
```

**Understanding Integer Division**:
```python
# // operator performs floor division (integer division)
# Always returns an integer, rounding down

# Examples:
len([1,2,3]) // 2 = 3 // 2 = 1      # Odd length
len([1,2,3,4]) // 2 = 4 // 2 = 2    # Even length
len([1,2,3,4,5]) // 2 = 5 // 2 = 2  # Odd length
```

**Why This Index is Always Valid**:
```python
# For any non-empty array:
# - Minimum length: 1 → middle_index = 0 (valid)
# - Maximum valid index: len(nums) - 1
# - Our calculation: len(nums) // 2 ≤ len(nums) - 1 (always valid)

# Mathematical proof:
# len(nums) // 2 ≤ (len(nums) - 1) for all len(nums) ≥ 1
```

### Step 3: Direct Element Access
```python
return nums[middle_index]
```

**Why This Always Returns Majority Element**:
```python
# Guarantee: The element at middle_index is always the majority element
# Proof by contradiction and mathematical properties shown in examples below
```

## Mathematical Proof Visualization

### Case Analysis: Odd Length Arrays

#### Example: n = 5, majority element appears 3 times
```python
# Original: [A, A, A, B, C] (any arrangement)
# After sort: All A's become consecutive

# Possible arrangements after sorting:
Arrangement 1: [A, A, A, B, C]
               0  1  2  3  4
                     ↑
              middle_index = 2
              nums[2] = A ✓

Arrangement 2: [B, A, A, A, C] 
               0  1  2  3  4
                     ↑
              middle_index = 2
              nums[2] = A ✓

Arrangement 3: [B, C, A, A, A]
               0  1  2  3  4
                     ↑
              middle_index = 2
              nums[2] = A ✓

# Conclusion: Regardless of arrangement, A always occupies index 2
```

#### Mathematical Explanation for Odd Length:
```python
# Array length: n = 2k + 1 (odd)
# Middle index: (2k + 1) // 2 = k
# Majority element count: > (2k + 1) / 2 = k + 0.5
# Therefore: Majority element appears at least k + 1 times

# Position analysis:
# - Even if majority element starts at position 0: occupies [0, k]
# - Even if majority element ends at position n-1: occupies [k, n-1]
# - In any case: majority element includes position k (middle_index)
```

### Case Analysis: Even Length Arrays

#### Example: n = 8, majority element appears 5 times
```python
# Original: [M,M,M,M,M,X,Y,Z] (M appears 5 times)
# All possible arrangements after sorting:

Case 1: M's at beginning
[M,M,M,M,M,X,Y,Z]
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
         ↑
    middle_index = 4
    nums[4] = M ✓

Case 2: M's in middle
[X,M,M,M,M,M,Y,Z]
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
         ↑
    middle_index = 4
    nums[4] = M ✓

Case 3: M's at end
[X,Y,Z,M,M,M,M,M]
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
         ↑
    middle_index = 4
    nums[4] = M ✓

# Conclusion: 5 consecutive M's must include index 4
```

#### Mathematical Explanation for Even Length:
```python
# Array length: n = 2k (even)
# Middle index: 2k // 2 = k
# Majority element count: > 2k / 2 = k
# Therefore: Majority element appears at least k + 1 times

# Position analysis:
# - Array has positions [0, 1, ..., k-1, k, k+1, ..., 2k-1]
# - Majority element occupies k+1 consecutive positions
# - Any block of k+1 consecutive positions in a 2k-length array
#   must include either position k-1, k, or both
# - Our middle_index = k, which is guaranteed to be included
```

## Step-by-Step Execution Trace

### Example 1: nums = [3,2,3]

#### Step 1: Initial State
```python
nums = [3, 2, 3]
n = len(nums) = 3
middle_index = 3 // 2 = 1
```

#### Step 2: Sorting Process
```python
# Before: [3, 2, 3]
nums.sort()
# After:  [2, 3, 3]

# Visual representation:
# Index:  0  1  2
# Value: [2, 3, 3]
#           ↑
#     middle_index = 1
```

#### Step 3: Result Extraction
```python
result = nums[middle_index] = nums[1] = 3

# Verification:
# Element 3 appears 2 times in original array
# 2 > 3/2 = 1.5 ✓ (satisfies majority condition)
```

### Example 2: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]

#### Step 1: Initial State
```python
nums = [2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2]
n = len(nums) = 7
middle_index = 7 // 2 = 3
```

#### Step 2: Sorting Process
```python
# Before: [2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2]
nums.sort()
# After:  [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2]

# Visual representation:
# Index:  0  1  2  3  4  5  6
# Value: [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2]
#                    ↑
#              middle_index = 3

# Element distribution:
# Element 1: positions [0, 1, 2] → 3 occurrences
# Element 2: positions [3, 4, 5, 6] → 4 occurrences
```

#### Step 3: Result Extraction
```python
result = nums[middle_index] = nums[3] = 2

# Verification:
# Element 2 appears 4 times in original array
# 4 > 7/2 = 3.5 ✓ (satisfies majority condition)
```

### Example 3: nums = [1,1,1,1,1,2,2,3] (n=8)

#### Step 1: Initial State
```python
nums = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3]
n = len(nums) = 8
middle_index = 8 // 2 = 4
```

#### Step 2: Sorting Process
```python
# Before: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3]
nums.sort()
# After:  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3] (already sorted)

# Visual representation:
# Index:  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7
# Value: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3]
#                       ↑
#                middle_index = 4
```

#### Step 3: Result Extraction
```python
result = nums[middle_index] = nums[4] = 1

# Verification:
# Element 1 appears 5 times in original array
# 5 > 8/2 = 4 ✓ (satisfies majority condition)
```

## Edge Cases Analysis

### Edge Case 1: Single Element Array
```python
nums = [42]
n = 1
middle_index = 1 // 2 = 0

# After sorting: [42] (unchanged)
# Result: nums[0] = 42 ✓

# Logic: Single element is always the majority
# Frequency: 1, Required: > 1/2 = 0.5 ✓
```

### Edge Case 2: Two Elements with Majority
```python
nums = [1, 1]
n = 2
middle_index = 2 // 2 = 1

# After sorting: [1, 1] (unchanged)
# Result: nums[1] = 1 ✓

# Logic: Element 1 appears 2 times
# Required: > 2/2 = 1, Actual: 2 ✓
```

### Edge Case 3: All Elements Identical
```python
nums = [7, 7, 7, 7, 7]
n = 5
middle_index = 5 // 2 = 2

# After sorting: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7] (unchanged)
# Result: nums[2] = 7 ✓

# Logic: Element 7 appears 5 times
# Required: > 5/2 = 2.5, Actual: 5 ✓
```

### Edge Case 4: Minimum Majority in Large Array
```python
nums = [1,1,1,2,3,4,5,6,7] # 1 appears 3 times out of 9
n = 9
middle_index = 9 // 2 = 4

# After sorting: [1,1,1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
# Index:          0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
#                       ↑
# Result: nums[4] = 3 ❌

# Wait - let's verify: Does 1 satisfy majority condition?
# 3 > 9/2 = 4.5? → 3 > 4.5? → False ❌
# This violates the problem constraint!

# Correct example for n=9:
nums = [1,1,1,1,1,2,3,4,5] # 1 appears 5 times out of 9
# After sorting: [1,1,1,1,1,2,3,4,5]
# Index:          0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
#                       ↑
# Result: nums[4] = 1 ✓
# Verification: 5 > 9/2 = 4.5 ✓
```

### Edge Case 5: Even Array with Exact Middle Split
```python
# This case cannot exist due to majority element definition
# For even n: majority requires > n/2 occurrences
# n=6: requires > 3, so at least 4 occurrences
# n=8: requires > 4, so at least 5 occurrences
# Perfect 50-50 split violates majority constraint

# Example that might seem problematic but isn't:
nums = [1,1,1,2,2,2] # No majority element
# This violates problem constraint: "majority element always exists"
```

## Performance Analysis

### Time Complexity: O(n log n)
```python
# Dominated by sorting operation:
nums.sort()  # O(n log n) - Timsort algorithm

# Other operations:
len(nums)    # O(1) - length access
// operator  # O(1) - integer division  
nums[index]  # O(1) - array access

# Total: O(n log n) + O(1) + O(1) + O(1) = O(n log n)
```

### Space Complexity: O(1)
```python
# In-place sorting (depends on implementation):
nums.sort()  # O(1) auxiliary space for in-place sort
             # Note: Python's Timsort may use O(n) in worst case

# Additional variables:
middle_index  # O(1) - single integer
return value  # O(1) - single element

# Practical space complexity: O(1) auxiliary space
# Note: Input array is modified in-place
```

### Memory Usage Considerations
```python
# Array modification:
# Original array is sorted in-place
# If preserving original order is required, create copy first:

def majorityElement_preserveOriginal(self, nums):
    sorted_nums = sorted(nums)  # O(n) additional space
    return sorted_nums[len(nums) // 2]

# Trade-off: O(n) space to preserve original vs O(1) space with modification
```

## Alternative Approaches Comparison

### Approach 1: Hash Map Counting (Most Intuitive)
```python
def majorityElement_hashmap(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
    count = {}
    majority_threshold = len(nums) // 2
    
    for num in nums:
        count[num] = count.get(num, 0) + 1
        if count[num] > majority_threshold:
            return num
```

**Analysis**:
- ✅ **Time Complexity**: O(n) - optimal
- ❌ **Space Complexity**: O(n) - uses additional hash map
- ✅ **Intuitive**: Direct frequency counting approach
- ✅ **Early Termination**: Can return as soon as majority found

### Approach 2: Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm (Optimal)
```python
def majorityElement_voting(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
    candidate = None
    count = 0
    
    # Phase 1: Find candidate
    for num in nums:
        if count == 0:
            candidate = num
        count += (1 if num == candidate else -1)
    
    # Phase 2: Verify candidate (optional, given problem guarantee)
    return candidate
```

**Analysis**:
- ✅ **Time Complexity**: O(n) - optimal
- ✅ **Space Complexity**: O(1) - optimal
- ❌ **Complexity**: Requires understanding of voting algorithm
- ❌ **Intuition**: Less obvious why it works

### Approach 3: Sorting + Middle Element (Your Solution)
```python
def majorityElement_sort(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
    nums.sort()
    return nums[len(nums) // 2]
```

**Analysis**:
- ❌ **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) - suboptimal
- ✅ **Space Complexity**: O(1) - optimal (in-place sort)
- ✅ **Simplicity**: Extremely simple and elegant
- ✅ **Intuition**: Mathematical property is easy to understand
- ✅ **Reliability**: Hard to implement incorrectly

### Approach 4: Randomized Algorithm
```python
import random

def majorityElement_random(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
    while True:
        candidate = random.choice(nums)
        if nums.count(candidate) > len(nums) // 2:
            return candidate
```

**Analysis**:
- ❌ **Deterministic**: Not deterministic behavior
- ❌ **Worst Case**: Could theoretically run forever
- ❌ **Practical**: Expected O(n) but with high variance
- ❌ **Interview**: Not suitable for interview settings

### Approach 5: Divide and Conquer
```python
def majorityElement_divide_conquer(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
    def majority_rec(left, right):
        if left == right:
            return nums[left]
        
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        left_majority = majority_rec(left, mid)
        right_majority = majority_rec(mid + 1, right)
        
        if left_majority == right_majority:
            return left_majority
        
        left_count = sum(1 for i in range(left, right + 1) if nums[i] == left_majority)
        right_count = sum(1 for i in range(left, right + 1) if nums[i] == right_majority)
        
        return left_majority if left_count > right_count else right_majority
    
    return majority_rec(0, len(nums) - 1)
```

**Analysis**:
- ✅ **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) - same as sorting
- ❌ **Space Complexity**: O(log n) - recursion stack
- ❌ **Complexity**: Much more complex implementation
- ❌ **Practical**: Overkill for this problem

```

### Pitfall 4: Inefficient Implementation
```python
# ❌ Counting every element:
